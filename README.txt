This project is a Chrome extension that helps with calculating grades. By inputting your desired final grade, how many points the next assignment is worth, and the assignment category (if the course uses weighted categories), the extension will calculate what grade you need on the next assignment based on your previous grades. It is fully automated in reading your grades, but it never stores any data out of security concerns.

Google Chrome
A student genesis account
